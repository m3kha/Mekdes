        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Mekdes Hailu, a dedicated and innovative Mechanical Engineer currently serving as a Development Engineer at Jinsol Turbo Machinery. I specialize in designing sophisticated heat exchangers and cooling systems, leveraging my Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from KAIST to push the boundaries of technology in thermal management solutions. My technical toolkit is robust, including advanced proficiency in Autodesk Inventor, SolidWorks, Python, MATLAB, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Additionally, I am licensed in a variety of semiconductor manufacturing processes such as E-beam deposition, Reactive Ion Etching (RIE), wet etching, double side alignment, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR).</p>
        <p>Outside of engineering, I engage in sports that challenge me both physically and mentally, such as badminton, skiing, and soccer. I'm also a passionate traveler, having explored diverse cultures and landscapes across countries like Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea, Singapore, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland. These experiences enrich my perspective and inspire innovation in my professional work.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I am deeply committed to the pursuit of excellence, continually seeking to learn and adopt new technologies. My career aspiration is to progress into a role where I can lead as a product owner or manager, guiding projects that innovate and set new standards in engineering.</p>
