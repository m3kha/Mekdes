        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm a dedicated and innovative Mechanical Engineer currently serving as a Development Engineer at Jinsol Turbo Machinery. I specialize in designing sophisticated heat exchangers and cooling systems, leveraging my Masterâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from KAIST to push the boundaries of technology in thermal management solutions.</p>
        <h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>
        <p>My technical toolkit is robust, including advanced proficiency in Autodesk Inventor, SolidWorks, Python, MATLAB, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Additionally, I am licensed in a variety of semiconductor manufacturing processes such as E-beam deposition, Reactive Ion Etching (RIE), wet etching, double side alignment, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR).</p>
        <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
        <p>When I'm not engineering, I enjoy engaging in sports that challenge me physically and mentally, such as badminton, skiing, and soccer. I also have a passion for traveling, having explored diverse cultures and landscapes across Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea, Singapore, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland. These experiences enrich my perspective and inspire innovation in my professional work.</p>
        <h3>Professional Philosophy and Goals</h3>
        <p>I am deeply committed to the pursuit of excellence in my field, continually seeking to learn and adopt new technologies. My career aspiration is to progress into a role where I can lead as a product owner or manager, guiding projects that innovate and set new standards in engineering.</p>
